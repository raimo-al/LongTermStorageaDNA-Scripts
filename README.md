# LongTermStorageaDNA pipeline
A bioinformatics pipeline for the analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA) samples.

This pipeline contains a set of scripts and customized code, which were originally developed for the analysis of ancient human genomic data generated for the project **"The effect of long-term storage on ancient DNA samples" (Master's thesis)**. 

Thesis available here: https://utheses.univie.ac.at/detail/74668
# Pipeline workflow:
The first part of the pipeline, **aDNAPrePro** (**v1.1**), is now available. The pipeline aDNAPrePro (V1.1) preprocesses aDNA samples.

# aDNAPrePro
## Installation and pipeline

First, run the following command in your shell:

```bash
wget -O aDNAPrePro-Installation.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raimo-al/LongTermStorageaDNA/main/modules/aDNAPrePro_preprocessing/aDNAPrePro-Installation.sh && bash aDNAPrePro-Installation.sh
```

## Requirements :
Before running the pipeline, please download your preferred **reference genome** into your scratch directory:

```bash
ScratchDir="/path/to/your/scratchdirectory/"
```

Please also insert the correct path to the reference genome in `$ref`. Otherwise, the following message will appear:

```text
ref="" is not defined. Please insert your path in aDNAPrePro-Step*.sh
```

Please also make sure that all shell scripts have permissions and are executable.

# RunAmber module (Changes ongoing):
## Installation and pipeline
```bash
wget -O RunAmber-Installation.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raimo-al/LongTermStorageaDNA/main/modules/RunAmber/RunAmber-Installation.sh && bash RunAmber-Installation.sh
```

## `aDNAPrePro-Installation.sh`:

This is the installation script and is executed automatically by the `wget` command above. If you use this command, all shell scripts will automatically receive the correct permissions and be made executable.

## `aDNAPrePro core pipeline scripts` :

## Important Note:

In each script, you need to insert the path to your scratch directory (`$ScratchDir`). If you installed the pipeline using `aDNAPrePro-Installation.sh`, please use the same path that you entered in the installation script.

**Example message**:

```text
$ScratchDir="" is not defined. Please insert your path in aDNAPrePro-Step*.sh
```

**Please launch the scripts in the following order:**

- `Step1.sh`: Step 1 consists of Adapter trimming with Cutadapt

Cutadapt: https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt; DOI:10.14806/ej.17.1.200

- `Step2.sh`: Step 2 consists of aligning your samples to the reference genome with bwa

bwa: (https://github.com/lh3/bwa; arXiv:1303.3997)

- `Step31.sh - Step34.sh`: All Step31.sh, Step32.sh, Step31.sh and Step34.sh use SAMtools.

SAMtools (https://github.com/samtools/samtools; https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giab008)

`Step31.sh`: Step31 consists of converting *.sam to *.bam (binary) files with the program SAMtools and keep only reads with mapping quality (MAPQ) = 30

`Step32.sh`: Step32 consists of sorting the *.bam" files into *"_sorted.bam" files.

`Step33.sh`: Step33 consists of sorting the *"_sorted.bam" files into *"_rmdup.bam" files

`Step34.sh`: Step34 consists of generating summary statistics using samtools flagstat

- `Step4CreateReport.sh`: creates a report (txt file) summarising the total, trimmed, unique/aligned and/or endogenous reads of all your samples.
