# LongTermStorageaDNA pipeline
A bioinformatics pipeline for the analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA) samples.

This pipeline contains a set of scripts and customized code, which were originally developed for the analysis of ancient human genomic data generated for the project **"The effect of long-term storage on ancient DNA samples" (Master's thesis)**. 

Thesis available here: https://utheses.univie.ac.at/detail/74668
# Pipeline workflow:
The pipeline is composed of modules, for which two are already available:

1. **aDNAPrePro** (**v1.1**)
The first part of the pipeline, **aDNAPrePro** (**v1.1**), is now available. The pipeline aDNAPrePro (V1.1) preprocesses aDNA samples.

2. **RunAmber** (**v1.0**)
The second module runs the python programe **AMBER** and fragmentation analysis (mean fragment length). 

# aDNAPrePro
## Installation and pipeline

First, run the following command in your shell:

```bash
wget -O aDNAPrePro-Installation.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raimo-al/LongTermStorageaDNA/main/modules/aDNAPrePro_preprocessing/aDNAPrePro-Installation.sh && bash aDNAPrePro-Installation.sh
```

## `aDNAPrePro-Installation.sh`:

This is the installation script and is executed automatically by the `wget` command above. If you use this command, all shell scripts will automatically receive the correct permissions and be made executable.

## Requirements :
Before running the pipeline, please download your preferred **reference genome** into your scratch directory:

```bash
ScratchDir="/path/to/your/scratchdirectory/"
```

Please also insert the correct path to the reference genome in `$ref`. Otherwise, the following message will appear:

```text
ref="" is not defined. Please insert your path in aDNAPrePro-Step*.sh
```

Please also make sure that all shell scripts have permissions and are executable.

## `aDNAPrePro core pipeline scripts` :

## Important Note:

In each script, you need to insert the path to your scratch directory (`$ScratchDir`). If you installed the pipeline using `aDNAPrePro-Installation.sh`, please use the same path that you entered in the installation script.

**Example message**:

```text
$ScratchDir="" is not defined. Please insert your path in aDNAPrePro-Step*.sh
```

**Please launch the scripts in the following order:**

- `Step1.sh`: Step 1 consists of Adapter trimming with Cutadapt

Cutadapt: https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt; DOI:10.14806/ej.17.1.200

- `Step2.sh`: Step 2 consists of aligning your samples to the reference genome with bwa

bwa: (https://github.com/lh3/bwa; arXiv:1303.3997)

- `Step31.sh - Step34.sh`: All Step31.sh, Step32.sh, Step31.sh and Step34.sh use SAMtools.

SAMtools (https://github.com/samtools/samtools; https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giab008)

`Step31.sh`: Step31 consists of converting *.sam to *.bam (binary) files with the program SAMtools and keep only reads with mapping quality (MAPQ) = 30

`Step32.sh`: Step32 consists of sorting the *.bam" files into *"_sorted.bam" files.

`Step33.sh`: Step33 consists of sorting the *"_sorted.bam" files into *"_rmdup.bam" files

`Step34.sh`: Step34 consists of generating summary statistics using samtools flagstat

- `Step4CreateReport.sh`: creates a report (txt file) summarising the total, trimmed, unique/aligned and/or endogenous reads of all your samples.

# RunAmber module (Changes ongoing):
## Installation and pipeline

First, run the following command in your shell:

```bash
wget -O RunAmber-Installation.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raimo-al/LongTermStorageaDNA/main/modules/RunAmber/RunAmber-Installation.sh && bash RunAmber-Installation.sh
```

## `RunAmber-Installation.sh`:

This is the installation script and is executed automatically by the `wget` command above. If you use this command, all shell scripts will automatically receive the correct permissions and be made executable.

## `RunAmber core pipeline scripts` :

- `RunAmber.sh`: specifically is a customized script, which was employed to run AMBER with multiple BAM files automatically and sequentially,
if they are located in the same directory, using the Python software AMBER.
This means the script automatically updates the list “BamList.tsv” with each new sample name, BAM file, and path,
representing a minor improvement that simplifies running multiple samples.
NOTE: Through the automatic updating of BamList.tsv, the script enables the analysis of more than 6 samples at a time.

AMBER: (https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae436)

- `MeanFrag.sh`: calculates mean fragment length for each from AMBER output and summarises it into a *.txt file (e.g. mean_fragment_length.txt).

Usage: 

**Single dataset:**
```bash
./MeanFrag.sh -i1 <Path/to/InputDir1> -c1 {st|N} -o <Path/to/OutputFile>
```

**Two datasets:**
```bash
./MeanFrag.sh -i1 <Path/to/InputDir1> -c1 {st|N} -i2 <Path/to/InputDir2> -c2 {st|N} -o <Path/to/OutputFile>
```

-o <Path/to/OutputFile> means for example ./Results/mean_fragment_length.txt

**Parameters:**

- -i1   Input directory for dataset 1 (AMBER output)
- -i2   Input directory for dataset 2 (optional)
- -c1   Cutoff value for dataset 1 (standard or numeric) 
- -c2   Cutoff for dataset 2 (optional)
- -o    Output file (e.g.: mean_fragment_length.txt)

**Cutoff options:**

- st    standard: computes mean fragment length using all reads
- N     numeric cutoff (e.g. 75): includes only reads = N bp: e.g. "-c1 90" truncates reads to 90bp

NOTE: The mean fragment lenghth can be computed for max 2 datasets at a time: i1, i2
