# Project name:  aDNAPrePro
# Version: 1.1
# Date: Mar 2026
# aDNAPrePro-Install.sh this is the first of nine scripts to preprocess ancient DNA samples.
# This script is optional; it sets up the environment required for the remaining seven scripts. 
#
## The computational results of this work have been achieved using the University of Vienna`s Life Science Compute Cluster (LiSC).
## This script has been written to work on the LiSC cluster. Using this Pipeline in a different environment, you would possibly need to install some programs. 

# aDNAPrePro-Install.sh: Installation script to run the aDNAPrePro pipeline.
##
# Usage:
# Two possibilities to make the installation script executable:
#1: After downloading the repository from GitHub, run the installation script with:
#     bash aDNAPrePro-Install.sh
#####2: Alternatively, after downloading the repository from GitHub, make the script executable and run it directly:
# chmod 754 aDNAPrePro-Install.sh
