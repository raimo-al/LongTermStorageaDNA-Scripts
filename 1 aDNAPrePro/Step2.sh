# Step2.sh this is the second of six scripts to preprocess ancient DNA.

## The computational results of this work have been achieved using the University of Vienna`s Life Science Compute Cluster (LiSC).
## This script has been written to work on the LiSC cluster. Using this Pipeline in a different environment, you would possibly need to install some programs. 

# Step2: Aligning the samples to the reference genome with bwa
# Software bwa (https://github.com/lh3/bwa; arXiv:1303.3997) 
##
# Usage:
# First time launching:
# chmod 754 Step2.sh
##
# Requirements: 
#	Input: *.fastq and indexed ReferenceGenome.fasta
#	Parameters:  -t 8 <NumberOfCPUThreads> ;  change "MyProject" with your project name: -R  '@RG\tID:MyProject\tSM:'${filename:9:6}'\tPL:ILLUMINA' <ReadGroupHeader>
#                    tSM <biological sample>; tLB: <sequencingLibrary>
#	Outputs: *.sam: alignments; *.sam.log: bwa log per sample

# Note: ${filename:9:6} extracts the sample identifier from the full file path.
# It removes the first 9 char (e.g. "./Step1d/") and then reads the next 6 char.
# This works ONLY if the files are located in a subdirectory with a 6 char name like "Step1d" (the path prefix has a total length of 9 char), 
# and the sample identifier consists of exactly 6 char (e.g. 123456).
#
# Example: ./Step1d/123456yyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.fastq
# the first 9 char ("./Step1d/") are ignored; the next 6 char ("123456") are extracted as the sample name.
