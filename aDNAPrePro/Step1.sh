# Step1.sh this is the first of six scripts to preprocess ancient DNA.

## The computational results of this work have been achieved using the University of Vienna`s Life Science Compute Cluster (LiSC).
## This script has been written to work on the LiSC cluster. Using this Pipeline in a different environment, you would possibly need to install some programs. 

# Step 1: Adapter trimming with Cutadapt
# Software Cutadapt (https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt; DOI:10.14806/ej.17.1.200) 
##
# Usage: 
##
# First time launching:
# chmod 754 Step1.sh
##
# Requirements: 
# 	Input *fastq.gz files
#       Parameters -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC <AdapterSequence> -m 30 <MinimumReadLength> 
#	Output: trimmed *fastq.gz files and *.log files

# Note: ${filename:9:6} extracts the sample identifier from the full file path.
# It removes the first 9 char (e.g. "./Step1d/") and then reads the next 6 char.
# This works ONLY if the files are located in a subdirectory with a 6 char name like "Step1d" (the path prefix has a total length of 9 char), 
# and the sample identifier consists of exactly 6 char (e.g. 123456).
#
# Example: ./Step1d/123456yyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.fastq
# the first 9 char ("./Step1d/") are ignored; the next 6 char ("123456") are extracted as the sample name.
