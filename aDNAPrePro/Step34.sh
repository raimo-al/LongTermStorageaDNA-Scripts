# Step34.sh this is the sixth of six scripts to preprocess ancient DNA.
#
## The computational results of this work have been achieved using the University of Vienna`s Life Science Compute Cluster (LiSC).
## This script has been written to work on the LiSC cluster. Using this Pipeline in a different environment, you would possibly need to install some programs. 

## Step34: Generates summary statistics using samtools flagstat
# Software SAMtools (https://github.com/samtools/samtools; https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giab008)
##
# Usage:
# First time using the script
# chmod 754 Step34.sh

# Requirements: 
# 	Input: sorted_rmdup.bam
#       Parameters:
#	Output:  Summary statistics text file *.tsv

# Note: ${filename:9:6} extracts the sample identifier from the full file path.
# It removes the first 9 char (e.g. "./Step1d/") and then reads the next 6 char.
# This works ONLY if the files are located in a subdirectory with a 6 char name like "Step1d" (the path prefix has a total length of 9 char), 
# and the sample identifier consists of exactly 6 char (e.g. 123456).
#
# Example: ./Step1d/123456yyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.fastq
# the first 9 char ("./Step1d/") are ignored; the next 6 char ("123456") are extracted as the sample name.
